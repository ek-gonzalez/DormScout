# DormScout
Project for SJSU CMPE 131. \
The project aims to develop a student housing review platform that allows university students to share their thoughts on nearby housing complexes. Features would include review posting, complex filtering based on multiple factors (affordability, proximity, amenitiesâ€¦), and potentially a forum for registered users to inquire about available units. In contrast to Google reviews, this platform will provide trusted opinions and relevant information by requiring student email verification for registered users and reviewers, ensuring that students make better housing decisions.
